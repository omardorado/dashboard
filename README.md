# Home Credit Risk Dashboard
This app is a dashboard that runs an analysis on any client from the Home Credit Database. Client info, a default payment risk prediction, a customizable comparison visualisation and an other visualisation statistic are displayed for the selected client

This app was created using python and the open-source app framework, streamlit. It relies on [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) data.

I hope you enjoy the app! This is my first time ever creating something like this, so any comments or feedback is greatly appreciated!
